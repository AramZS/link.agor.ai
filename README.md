# Welcome to the Agora of the Link!

This Agora is maintained by the [Fellowship of the Link](https://anagora.org/fotl). You should be able to see it live at <https://link.agor.ai>.

# Wait, what's an Agora again?

It's a *Knowledge Commons* maintained by a Community of Practice. In this case, this means the Fellowship of the Link and our friends.

An Agora's architecture has several components distributed over three git repositories:

- The *Agora root repository*, which you are browsing: <https://github.com/flancian/link.agor.ai>. 
  - This root repository contains a high level definition of the Agora as expressed by the list of digital gardens to be integrated (`sources.yaml`) and the contract agreed upon by the community (`CONTRACT.md`).
- The *Agora Server*: <https://github.com/flancian/agora-server>.
  - Which contains a reference Python / Flask web app that integrates and serves content. It is live at <https://anagora.org>.
- The *Agora Bridge*: <https://github.com/flancian/agora-bridge>.
  - Which contains a set of processes to retrieve content as volunteered by users.
